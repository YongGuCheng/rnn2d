This directory contains some reference implementations using Theano, that were
used to check my implementation.

The LSTM-2D implementation is from Paul Voigtlaender. I took it from the
RETURNN software released by Aachen University and adapted to run it standalone:

The demos use a Numpy/Theano wrapper for the Baidu's CTC implementation:
